# Neural_Network

This challenge was just that...challenging. I wasn't able to achieve the 75% accuracy mark.
This Neural Network model contains 6 layers and 34 neurons with an accuracy of 72.2%.
I tried a plethora of different options to try and raise the percentage but all were slightly or signifcantly worse with my inital model only achieving 48%.
My first attempt was to change the activations for both input and output layers. I went through every iteration but the highest yield was "tanh" input and "sigmoid" as the output.
Second was to change what columns were dropped leaving the "NAME", "EIN", and "CLASSIFICATION" columns consistently dropped but this yielded a slight or no change in the accuracy.
The third attempt was to change the epoch # along with how many hidden layers with 6 layers and 125 epochs. Any more of either yields hardly change with the loss becoming redundant.
I'm ashamed to admit that this was the best I could come up with, unfortunately I was unable to dedicate an adequate amount of time to this challenge.
